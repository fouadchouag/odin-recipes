    <h3>Recipe</h3>
    <p>
        The only time consuming part is letting those chicken breasts cook through completely. From there, you can melt some butter in those pan drippings alongside some garlic, fresh rosemary and lemon juice for all that saucy saucy goodness. <br>
        Serve with a light salad and crusty bread for a complete meal.
    </p>

    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3> 
    <ol>
        <li>Season chicken with salt and pepper, to taste.</li>
        <li>Heat canola oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Working in batches, add chicken to the skillet in a single layer and cook until golden brown, about 4-5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium low. Using tongs, flip and cook, covered, until cooked through, reaching an internal temperature of 165 degrees F, an additional 8 minutes; set aside and keep warm.</li>
        <li>Melt 1 tablespoon butter in the skillet over medium low heat. Add garlic, shallot and rosemary, and cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant, about 2 minutes; season with salt and pepper, to taste.</li>
        <li>Whisk in flour until lightly browned, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Stir in chicken stock, scraping any browned bits from the bottom of the skillet. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until reduced and thickened, about 4-5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in lemon juice and remaining 1 tablespoon butter; season with salt and pepper, to taste. Return chicken to the skillet.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
